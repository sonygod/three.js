Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they're necessary:

- **Haxe doesn't have template literals:**  The backticks (`) used in JavaScript for template literals don't exist in Haxe. Instead, we use triple quotes (`""" ... """) to define multiline strings.
- **No `export default`:** Haxe uses a different module system.  You define classes and mark members you want to be accessible from outside the module with `public`.
- **Encapsulated in a class:** It's good practice in Haxe to organize code within classes, even for utility functions like this. 

**How to use this:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the Haxe code as a `.hx` file (e.g., `ShaderUtil.hx`).
2. **Compile:** Use the Haxe compiler to compile your project. How you do this depends on your build system.
3. **Access the string:** In your main Haxe code, you can access the GLSL code like this: 

   
   var glslCode:String = ShaderUtil.main();
