class Main {
  public static function main():Void {
    var glsl = /* glsl */"
ToonMaterial material;
material.diffuseColor = diffuseColor.rgb;
";
  }
}


Here's a breakdown of the changes and considerations:

- **Haxe doesn't have template literals with tags:** In JavaScript, you're using a tagged template literal with `/* glsl */` to potentially process the string. Haxe doesn't directly support this syntax. We'll simply store the GLSL code as a regular string.
- **Variable usage:** I'm assuming `diffuseColor` is a variable you intend to use within your Haxe code when working with this GLSL snippet. Make sure to define and handle it appropriately in your Haxe context.

**Example usage in Haxe (conceptual):**


class MyShader {
  public var shaderProgram:Dynamic; // Assuming you have a shader program setup

  public function setDiffuseColor(diffuseColor:Vector3) {
    // ... logic to send 'diffuseColor' to your shader ...

    // Accessing and potentially using the GLSL snippet
    trace(/* glsl */"
      ToonMaterial material;
      material.diffuseColor = diffuseColor.rgb;
    "); 
  }
}
