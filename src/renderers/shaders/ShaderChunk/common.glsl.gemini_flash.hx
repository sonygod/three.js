class Main {
  public static function main(): Void {
    // The provided code is a GLSL shader, not JavaScript.
    // GLSL is a separate language used for graphics programming
    // and cannot be directly converted to Haxe.

    // However, you can use Haxe libraries like hx3d or Kha 
    // to work with shaders in your Haxe projects.
  }
}


**Explanation:**

- The code you provided is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is designed specifically for programming graphics processing units (GPUs). 
- Haxe is a general-purpose programming language and doesn't have built-in support for directly converting or executing GLSL code.

**Alternatives:**

1. **Use Haxe libraries for 3D graphics:**
   - **hx3d:** A 3D engine for Haxe ([https://github.com/hx3d/hx3d](https://github.com/hx3d/hx3d)).
   - **Kha:** A low-level cross-platform multimedia framework ([https://github.com/Kode/Kha](https://github.com/Kode/Kha)).
   - These libraries provide ways to load and use shaders in your Haxe projects.

2. **Embed GLSL code as strings:**
   - You can store your GLSL code as strings within your Haxe code and then pass it to the appropriate graphics APIs when needed.
   - Example:

     
     class MyShader {
       public static var vertexShader: String = 
         "#version 300 es\n" +
         "in vec3 position;\n" +
         // ... rest of your GLSL code ...
       ;
     }
