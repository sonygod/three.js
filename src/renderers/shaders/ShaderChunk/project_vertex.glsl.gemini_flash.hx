Here's a breakdown of the changes and considerations:

* **Haxe doesn't directly support GLSL embedding:**  The `/* glsl */` syntax is specific to JavaScript and tools that understand it. In Haxe, you typically handle GLSL code as strings.
* **String Concatenation:**  We use string concatenation (`+`) to build the GLSL code within the `main` function.  This makes the code more readable and manageable.
* **Class Structure (Optional):** Enclosing the code within a `Shader` class is a common practice for organization. It allows you to group related shaders and potentially add helper methods in the future.

**How to Use This in Haxe/Heaps (Example):**

Assuming you're using the Heaps engine, you would typically load this GLSL code when creating a shader:


// ... other imports
import h3d.shader.BaseShader;

class MyShader extends BaseShader {
  public function new() {
    super(Shader.main(), null); // Assuming 'null' for fragment shader
  }
}
