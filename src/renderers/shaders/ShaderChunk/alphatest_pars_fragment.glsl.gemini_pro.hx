class ShaderChunk {
  public static function getUseAlphaTest():String {
    return /* glsl */  "
#ifdef USE_ALPHATEST
	uniform float alphaTest;
#endif
";
  }
}


Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* **Class Structure:** Haxe requires code to be organized within classes. We've created a `ShaderChunk` class to hold the GLSL code snippet.
* **Static Function:** We've encapsulated the GLSL code within a static function called `getUseAlphaTest()`. This makes it easy to access the code from other parts of your Haxe project.
* **String Return Type:** The function is designed to return the GLSL code as a string. 

**How to use it:**


// Assuming you have a shader program object
var myShader:ShaderProgram = ...;

// Access and use the GLSL code snippet
var alphaTestChunk:String = ShaderChunk.getUseAlphaTest(); 
myShader.addSource(alphaTestChunk); // Or however you incorporate shaders in your Haxe framework
