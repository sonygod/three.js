class ShaderChunk {
  public static function main(): String {
    return "#ifdef USE_MAP
	uniform sampler2D map;
#endif";
  }
}


Here's a breakdown of the changes and considerations:

* **No Direct Equivalent to `export default`:** Haxe doesn't have a direct counterpart to JavaScript's `export default`. Instead, we create a class (in this case, `ShaderChunk`) and define a static function (`main`) to hold the GLSL code string.
* **String Literals:** Haxe uses single quotes (') or triple quotes (''') for string literals. We've switched to single quotes here.
* **GLSL Code Preservation:** The most important part is preserving the GLSL code within the Haxe string.  The backticks (`) used in JavaScript are not strictly necessary in Haxe for single-line strings, so they've been removed.
* **Usage in your Haxe Project:**  You'll likely want to access and use this GLSL code from other parts of your Haxe project. You can do this by calling `ShaderChunk.main()`.

**Example Usage:**


class MyRenderer {
  public function new() {
    var shaderCode = ShaderChunk.main();
    // ... Use the shaderCode in your rendering setup
  }
}
