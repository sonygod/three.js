class Shader {
  public static function getShader(): String {
    var result = "";

    #if macro
      result += "#ifdef USE_ALPHAMAP\n";
      result += "\tuniform sampler2D alphaMap;\n";
      result += "#endif\n";
    #end

    return result;
  }
}


**Explanation:**

1. **Class Structure:**  We create a class named `Shader` to encapsulate the shader code. This is not strictly necessary but helps with organization, especially for larger shaders.

2. **Static Function:** We define a static function `getShader()` to return the GLSL code as a string. This makes it easy to access and use the shader code from other parts of your Haxe code.

3. **Conditional Compilation (`#if macro`)**: We use Haxe's conditional compilation feature to replicate the `#ifdef` preprocessor directive from GLSL.
   - `#if macro`: This block will be executed during the macro processing stage in Haxe. This is crucial because we want to manipulate the shader string before it's passed to the graphics API.
   - Inside the `#if macro` block, we build the shader code string just like you would in JavaScript, including the `#ifdef USE_ALPHAMAP` directive and its corresponding code.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Import:** Import the `Shader` class into your Haxe file.
2.  **Access the Shader Code:** Call `Shader.getShader()` to retrieve the GLSL code as a string.

**Example:**


import Shader; 

class Main {
  static function main() {
    var shaderCode = Shader.getShader();
    trace(shaderCode); // Output the generated GLSL code
  }
}
