}


Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they were made:

* **Haxe doesn't have template literals:**  JavaScript's backticks (`) for template literals aren't directly supported in Haxe.  We use standard string concatenation within a `String` variable.
* **Preserving GLSL Code:** The `/* glsl */` comment is kept to indicate the string contains GLSL code. This is useful for Haxe tools or workflows that might process GLSL shaders separately.
* **Class Structure (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary, it's often good practice in Haxe to encapsulate code within a class. This provides better organization, especially as your shader code grows.

**Explanation:**

* **`class Shader { ... }`:** Defines a class named `Shader`. This helps organize the shader code.
* **`public static var source: String = ...;`:** 
    * `public`:  Makes the `source` variable accessible from outside the `Shader` class.
    * `static`:  Indicates that the `source` variable belongs to the class itself, not to individual instances of the class.
    * `var source: String`: Declares a variable named `source` of type `String`.
    * `= ...;`: Assigns the GLSL code string to the `source` variable.

**How to use this Haxe code:**

You would typically access the GLSL code from another part of your Haxe project using:


var glslSource = Shader.source;
