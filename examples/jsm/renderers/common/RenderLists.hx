Here is the equivalent Haxe code:
```
package three.js.examples.jvm.renderers.common;

import haxe.ds.ObjectMap;

class RenderLists {
    private var lists:ObjectMap<Array<Dynamic>, RenderList>;

    public function new() {
        lists = new ObjectMap();
    }

    public function get(scene:Dynamic, camera:Dynamic):RenderList {
        var keys:Array<Dynamic> = [scene, camera];
        var list:RenderList = lists.get(keys);
        if (list == null) {
            list = new RenderList();
            lists.set(keys, list);
        }
        return list;
    }

    public function dispose():Void {
        lists = new ObjectMap();
    }
}
```
Note that I made the following changes:

* Imported `haxe.ds.ObjectMap` instead of `ChainMap` since Haxe's `ObjectMap` is equivalent to a JavaScript `Map`.
* Changed the class and variable declarations to Haxe syntax.
* Replaced `undefined` with `null` since Haxe uses `null` to represent the absence of a value.
* Removed the `export default` statement since Haxe does not require it.
* Changed the type annotations to match Haxe's type system.
* Changed the `get` method's parameter types to `Dynamic` since Haxe is a statically-typed language and requires explicit type annotations.

Please note that this conversion assumes that `RenderList` is a valid Haxe class. If it's not, you'll need to convert that class as well.
