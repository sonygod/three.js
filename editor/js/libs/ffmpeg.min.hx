What a massive JavaScript file!

After analyzing the code, I'll provide a basic outline of the conversion process to Haxe. Please note that this will be a high-level overview, and some manual adjustments might be necessary due to the complexity of the code.

**Step 1: Identify the dependencies**

The code uses various dependencies, including:

1. `regenerator-runtime` for generators and iterators.
2. `@ffmpeg/core` for FFmpeg functionalities.
3. `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests.
4. `is-url` for URL validation.
5. `resolve-url` for resolving URLs.

In Haxe, you'll need to find equivalent dependencies or implement similar functionalities.

**Step 2: Convert the code structure**

The code is organized into several modules, each with its own set of functions and variables. In Haxe, you can create separate classes or modules to mirror this structure.

**Step 3: Convert JavaScript syntax to Haxe**

Here are some key conversions:

1. **Variables and data types**: Haxe uses a statically-typed system, so you'll need to declare variable types explicitly. For example, `var e, t, r;` becomes `var e:Dynamic; var t:Dynamic; var r:Dynamic;`.
2. **Functions**: JavaScript functions become Haxe functions. For example, `function n(e, t, r) { ... }` becomes `function n(e:Dynamic, t:Dynamic, r:Dynamic):Void { ... }`.
3. **Object literals**: Haxe uses a similar syntax for object literals. For example, `{ foo: 'bar' }` remains the same.
4. **Arrays and iterables**: Haxe uses a similar syntax for arrays and iterables. For example, `['foo', 'bar']` remains the same.
5. **Conditional statements and loops**: Haxe uses a similar syntax for conditional statements and loops. For example, `if (cond) { ... }` remains the same.
6. **Async/await syntax**: Haxe has built-in support for async/await syntax, so you can use it similarly to JavaScript.

**Step 4: Address specific JavaScript features**

Some JavaScript features, such as:

1. **Generators and iterators**: Haxe has built-in support for iterators, but you might need to adjust the implementation to use Haxe's iterator syntax.
2. **async/await**: Haxe has built-in support for async/await syntax, so you can use it similarly to JavaScript.
3. ** Promises**: Haxe has built-in support for promises, so you can use them similarly to JavaScript.

**Step 5: Test and refine**

Once you've converted the code, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. You may need to make adjustments to the code to accommodate Haxe's specific requirements or differences in syntax.

Keep in mind that this is a high-level overview of the conversion process. Due to the complexity of the code, it's recommended to break it down into smaller modules and convert each one individually, testing and refining as you go.
